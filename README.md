<h1 align="center">Hey, I'm Harry! ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

I'm a product-focused **software engineer** from London, England. I'm interested in open source, keeping software simple, and building products that make a difference.

## What I'm focusing on ðŸŽ§

I'm currently focused on expanding my knowledge of software engineering and general productivity. I also enjoy creating my own projects and I'd like to invest more time on that going forward.
